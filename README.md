üöÄ Diving into Fashion MNIST with Neural Networks! üëóüëû

I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project, where I developed a deep learning model using the Fashion MNIST dataset! This dataset includes various clothing categories such as T-shirts, dresses, sneakers, and more, providing a perfect challenge for classification tasks.

Key Highlights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and visualized the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Explored the data using sample images, labels, and basic statistical analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture:
Built a neural network with the following structure:

Input Layer: Flattened images of size 28x28 pixels.
Hidden Layers:
Dense layer with 120 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 16 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output Layer: Softmax activation to classify 10 categories.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Training the Model:

Compiled the model with the categorical_crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Achieved significant improvements in accuracy over 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation and Validation:

Evaluated the model's performance on unseen validation data.
Used visualizations to analyze predictions and misclassifications.

What I Learned:
The importance of tuning neural network architectures for optimal performance.
Techniques to visualize and interpret model predictions effectively.
Overcoming common challenges like mismatched data shapes and hyperparameter optimization.
This project has deepened my understanding of deep learning for image classification tasks, and I‚Äôm eager to explore more complex datasets and models.
